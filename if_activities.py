#lines beginning with ## are my notes



##ACTIVITY 1
 # Create a variable called Password
# Password = "coding"

# # Check the length of the password
# if len(Password) < 8:
#     print("The password is too short.")
# else:
#     print("The password length is sufficient.")


##ACTIVITY 2
# # Create a variable called num
# num = 15  # Replace with any number you want to check

# # Check if num is divisible by 3 or 5
# if num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0:
#     print("this number is divisible by 3 or 5")
# else:
#     print("this number is not divisible by 3 or 5")



#ACTIVITY 3

# # # Create a variable called num
# num = 11  # Replace with any number you want to check

# # Check divisibility conditions
# if num % 3 == 0 and num % 7 == 0:
#     print("fizzbang")
# elif num % 3 == 0:
#     print("fizz")
# elif num % 7 == 0:
#     print("bang")
# else:
#     print("this number is not divisible by 3 or 7")


##ACTIVITY 4

# print("What is the capital of England?")

# answer = input("Type your answer here >> ")

# if answer.lower() == "london":
#     print(f"Correct! The answer is {answer.capitalize()}.")
# else:
#     print(f"Incorrect, the answer is 'London', not {answer}.")


##ACTIVITY 5
# # Create a variable called "word" that takes a string
# word = "envelope"  # Replace with any string to test

# # Create an if statement that checks if the last letter is the same as the first
# if word[0] == word[-1]:
#     result = True
# else:
#     result = False

# # Print the result
# print(result)

##ACTIVITY 5 stretch

# # Create a variable called "word" that takes a string
# word = "poop"  # Replace with any string to test

# # Create an if statement that checks if the whole string is a palindrome
# if word == word[::-1]:
#     print("The word is a palindrome.")
# else:
#     print("The word is not a palindrome.")
